    "* A database is a structured collection of data organized and stored in a computer system. It is designed to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage large amounts of information. Databases are used in various applications and industries to store and organize data in a way that facilitates data manipulation, analysis, and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "* SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two different types of database management systems that differ in their data models, storage mechanisms, and querying languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SQL Databases: \n",
    "   SQL databases are based on the relational data model and use structured query language (SQL) for managing and manipulating the data. They organize data into tables with predefined schemas, where each table consists of rows and columns. The relationship between tables is established using primary and foreign keys. Some popular SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "    Key characteristics of SQL databases:\n",
    "* Structured data with predefined schemas\n",
    "* Support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties\n",
    "* Well-suited for complex queries and transactions\n",
    "* Strong data consistency guarantees\n",
    "* Vertically scalable (scaling by adding more resources to a single server)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "    NoSQL databases encompass various non-relational data models and provide flexible schema designs. They are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data efficiently. NoSQL databases offer different data models such as key-value, document, columnar, and graph databases. Some popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Neo4j.\n",
    "    Key characteristics of NoSQL databases:\n",
    "* Flexible schema, allowing for dynamic and unstructured data\n",
    "* Distributed and horizontally scalable (scaling by adding more servers to the database cluster)\n",
    "* Eventual consistency model\n",
    "* Support for large-scale data storage and high write/read throughput\n",
    "* Well-suited for handling semi-structured and unstructured data, such as JSON documents or time-series data\n",
    "\n",
    "    In summary, SQL databases are based on the relational model and use SQL for data manipulation, while NoSQL databases provide various data models and are designed for handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of the application, data model complexity, scalability needs, and performance considerations."

    "\n",
    "* Here are the explanations of the commonly used DDL statements:   \n",
    "1. CREATE:\n",
    "    The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, or schemas. It specifies the name of the object, its structure, and any associated constraints or properties.\n",
    "* For example, to create a new table named \"Employees\" with columns for \"ID,\" \"Name,\" and \"Salary,\" we can use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "    ID INT,\n",
    "    Name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    Salary DECIMAL(10,2)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DROP:\n",
    "    The DROP statement is used to remove or delete existing database objects. It permanently deletes the object and its associated data from the database.\n",
    "    For example, to delete the \"Employees\" table created above, we can use the DROP TABLE statement:\n",
    "    \" DROP TABLE Employees;\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER:\n",
    "    The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. It allows you to add, modify, or delete columns, constraints, or other properties of the object.\n",
    "    For example, to add a new column named \"Department\" to the \"Employees\" table, we can use the ALTER TABLE statement:\n",
    "    \" ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "      ADD Department VARCHAR(50);\"\n",
    "      \n",
    "4. TRUNCATE:The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all data from a table, while keeping the table structure intact. It is faster than the DELETE statement for removing all records from a table since it doesn't generate individual row-level delete operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "     For example, to remove all data from the \"Employees\" table, we can use the TRUNCATE TABLE statement:\n",
    "     \" TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\"\n",

For example, to insert a new employee record into an \"Employees\" table with columns for \"ID,\" \"Name,\" and \"Salary,\" you can use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "    \"INSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name, Salary)\n",
    "    VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 50000);\"\n",
    "2. UPDATE:\n",
    "    The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a table. It allows you to change the values of one or more columns based on specified conditions. For example, to update the salary of an employee with ID 1 to 60000, we can use the following SQL statement:\n",

    "* Primary Key:\n",
    "    A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each row or record in the table. It ensures that each row in the table has a unique identifier. The primary key constraint guarantees the uniqueness and the non-nullability of the key values.\n",
    "* Key characteristics of a primary key:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique. No two rows in the table can have the same primary key value.\n",
    "2. Non-nullability: The primary key column(s) cannot have null values. Every row must have a value in the primary key column(s).\n",
    "3. Single value or combination: The primary key can be a single column or a combination of columns, depending on the requirements of the table structure.\n",
    "4. Indexing: Primary keys are typically indexed to optimize query performance and enforce uniqueness efficiently.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "    Consider a table named \"Customers\" with columns \"CustomerID,\" \"Name,\" \"Email,\" and \"Phone.\" To set the \"CustomerID\" column as the primary key, we can define it as follows:\n",
    "    * CREATE TABLE Customers (\n",

    "2. Foreign Key:\n",
    "* A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that establishes a link or relationship between two tables. It represents a reference to the primary key column(s) of another table. The foreign key constraint maintains the referential integrity between related tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Key characteristics of a foreign key:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Referential relationship: The foreign key references the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.\n",
    "2. Data consistency: The foreign key ensures that the values in the referencing column(s) correspond to the values in the referenced primary key column(s).\n",
    "3. Optional or mandatory: Depending on the relationship, a foreign key column can allow null values or be non-null.\n",
    "4. Cascading actions: Foreign keys can have cascading actions such as ON DELETE or ON UPDATE, which specify the actions to be performed on related rows when the referenced rows are deleted or updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "    Consider two tables, \"Orders\" and \"Customers.\" The \"Orders\" table has a foreign key relationship with the \"Customers\" table, where the \"CustomerID\" column in the \"Orders\" table references the primary key \"CustomerID\" in the \"Customers\" table. The foreign key constraint ensures that every order in the \"Orders\" table corresponds to a valid customer in the \"Customers\" table.\n",
    "    * \"CREATE TABLE Orders (\n",
    "        OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "        OrderDate DATE,\n",
